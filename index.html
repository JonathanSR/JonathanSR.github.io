    Hi, I'm a software Developer who is on a constant mission to make a positive impact using tech.

<div class="about">
I currently reside in Denver, CO and have for the most part spent most of my years in this beautiful state.
Before my dive into tech I wore many hats from baggage handler to dock worker to logistics coordinator.
Not wanting to be another statistic I decided to pursue an education at Turing School of Software and Design.
My hobbies include working out with an amazing community at Crossfit <a href="http://crossfitvantage.com/">Vantage</a>, reading and writing code.
Feel free to browse around, checkout my projects, read my blog.
