    Hi, I'm a software Developer who is on a constant mission to make a positive impact using tech.

<div class="about">
    I currently reside in Denver and have for the better part of my years spent my time in this beatiful state of Colorado.
    Before my dive into programming I wore many hats, from baggage handler to logistics coordinator. 
    Wanting to create a better world for my community and be an inspiration to those around me I decided to puruse an education at Turing School of Software and Design.
    With the help of Turing I was able to transform my interest into my passion and career.
    My hobbies include working out with an amazing community at Crossfit <a href="http://crossfitvantage.com">Vantage</a>, reading and traveling.
    Feel free to browse around, checkout my projects, read my blog.
