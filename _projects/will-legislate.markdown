Will Legislate for Money is a Python/Django app built as a tool to give voters easier access to information on their legislator's campaign funding and congressional action.
<br/>
This was a four team project broken up into two 3-day sprints. The objective was to take a brownfield application and implement reasonable functionality in the given time frame. My team and I managed to implement chart visualization of the data and toggle back between the charts and the default format of tables. We also implemented Twitter Oauth to log in a user to allow that user to follow members of congress through this app.
<br>
Will Legislate was mine and my teams first introduction into Python and Django which made it challenging to get up and running with features.
